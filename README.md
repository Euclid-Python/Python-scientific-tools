This tutorial is comprised of a series of <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target_="blanck">Jupyter notebooks</a> with simple demonstrations and exercises.

All code blocks are provided in Python (support for >=3.5) and the number of external packages required to run the examples has be kept to a minimum. All of the code has been clearly presented inside the notebook at least once to avoid the use of any "black boxes" for solving the problems presented.

### Requirements

In order to run the tutorial notebooks tutees will need to have the following installed:

* <a href="https://www.python.org/" target_="blank">Python</a> (require >=3.5)
* <a href="https://www.astropy.org/" target_="blank">Astropy</a> (recommend >=3.1.2)
* <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target_="blank">Jupyter</a> (recommend >=1.0.0)
* <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target_="blank">Matplotlib</a> (recommend >=3.0.3)
* <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" target_="blank">NumPy</a> (recommend >=1.16.2)
* <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target_="blank">Pandas</a> (recommend >= 0.24.0)
* <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target_="blank">scikit-learn</a> (recommend >= 0.21.0)
* <a href="https://www.scipy.org/" target_="blank">SciPy</a> (recommend >=1.2.1)
* <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/" target_="blank">Seaborn</a> (recommend >= 0.9.0)

### Notebooks


#### Tutorial: Python Scientific Tools

The objective of this tutorial is to teach the user how to work with some packages commonly used in the scientific community. 
Numpy for fast and efficient array processing and numeric, mathematical work.
Pandas for working with databases, tables and statistical tools.
Scipy for scientific-related work, such as integrals, special functions and differential equations.
Matplotlib for scientific visualization and plotting.
The examples are based on work with astrophysics and cosmology but can easily be adapted to any other field and don't require any previous knowledge in these fields.

1. [Pandas](./Pandas.ipynb)
1. [Scipy-Matplotlib (Cosmo)](./Scipy-Matplotlib-Cosmo.ipynb)

Answers to the exercises will be added after the workshop.
